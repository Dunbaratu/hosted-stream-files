  <h3>Softlock bug in Thief 1: Return to the Haunted Cathedral</h3>

  <p>
    After doing a bunch of fetch quests to help some ghost, you are given
    access to a bomb and a fire arrow and a note.  The note says you can
    force gates open using the bomb if you set the bomb off with fire.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bug:
    
    If you set off the bomb doing what the note says, using the fire effect
    from the fire arrow, which is <i>an area-of-effect around the impact of
    the arrow</i>, the gate will not open, even though the bomb still exploded.
    Now you are softlocked and cannot end the level because the bomb is
    gone and didn't work like the note said it would.

    Avoiding the bug:

    Hit the bomb directly with the tip of the fire arrow, don't just catch
    the bomb in the arrow's fire effect.  The note implies it's the fire of
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason I call it a bug:

    The note implies it's the fire igniting the bomb that opens the gate and
    that's a blatant lie.  The fire is NOT what causes it.  The trigger the game
    actually uses is that it checks when there's a collisions between a fire arrow
    and another object.  If the fire arrow collides with the bomb, that opens
    the gate if the gate is next to the bomb.  The fact that fire arrow
    collisions also cause fire around the area of impact has nothing to do with
    the actual check.  The game claimed it was the fire that causes it, and it's
    not.

    The check *belonged* not in the "arrow collide with thing" event, but in the
    "bomb blows up" event.  Because that's when the one-time object gets consumed,
    so that's when the check should happen.  Then it would work both on direct hits 
    of the fire arrow and area-of-effect hits of the fire arrow.
