Files I want my stream 'bots to see in a URL (basically using this like a pastebin).

I am using this like a pastebin so my Nightbot for Twitch can see this data in a URL (a URL to this git repo's raw file view), but without having to mess about with a pastebin account or pastebin auth key.  Because I am already set up to use github from bash scripting this was easier to do.
